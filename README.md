# 3DWaterMarking
 OpenCV implementation, code dated back to 2002 during my internship at TÜBİTAK BİLTEN (now TÜBİTAK UZAY)

I rather share the work than stored in my computer. A brief presentation is included. 

Code is based on
Cayre, F., & Macq, B. (2003). Data hiding on 3-D triangle meshes. IEEE Transactions on signal Processing, 51(4), 939-949.
