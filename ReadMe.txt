	3D Watermarking Project
	This work is based on the paper "Data Hiding on 3-D Triangle Meshes" by François Cayre and Benoît Macq,
	This work is an implementation of this method. The program uses MFC programming capabilities
	besides STL.

	Classes:

	* CAboutDlg, CDlgOglApp, CDlgOglDlg are MFC Classes.
	* CGlView is OpenGL Display Class
	* CCector2 and CVector are used for 3D point and triangles' vertices handling.
	* ObjLoader basically loads on obj file to memory.
	* TSPS is the class where algorithm implemented.
